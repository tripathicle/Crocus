# ðŸŒ± Crocus IAC: Enterprise-Grade Azure Infrastructure & DevOps Automation

---

## Overview
**Crocus IAC** is a **modular, secure, and enterprise-ready Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework** built with **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps**.  

It provisions, manages, and governs complete Azure environments â€” from **foundational landing zones** to **complex microservices platforms** â€” while following strict **DevSecOps principles**.

This repository acts as the **parent module / control plane**, orchestrating a library of **generic, versioned Terraform modules** to deliver consistent and compliant infrastructure across **Sandbox, Development, and Production** environments.

---

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with **Contributor** role  
- Azure DevOps project configured  
- Terraform `>= 1.0.0` installed locally  
- Azure CLI installed & authenticated  

### Deploying (Dev Environment)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tripathicle/Crocus.git
cd crocus-iac-env

# Navigate to environment
cd environments/development

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan & Apply (local testing only; use pipeline for official)
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

```

## Features & Highlights

- **Generic & Modular IaC**  
  - Dynamic blocks and `for_each` loops for all Azure services.  
  - Modules for Management Groups, Subscriptions, Networking, AKS, App Gateway, Front Door, etc.  

- **End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline**  
  - Automated CI/CD with:
    - Linting â†’ `tflint`
    - Security scans â†’ `checkov`, `tfsec`, `trufflehog`
    - Compliance checks â†’ Chef InSpec
    - Quality gates â†’ SonarQube  

- **Multi-Environment Strategy**  
  - Blueprints for Sandbox, Development, and Production with approvals and environment-specific variables.  

- **Security & Governance**  
  - Azure Policies (built-in + custom), aligned with **CIS Benchmarks & GDPR**.  
  - Remote state files encrypted with **Customer Managed Keys (CMK)**.  

- **Microservices & AKS Ready**  
  - AKS landing zones, ACR, Key Vault, Bastion Hosts.  
  - GitOps (ArgoCD) & Helm adoption planned.  

- **Operational Excellence**  
  - Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog monitoring.  
  - Automated backup & rollback pipelines for resilience.

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Repository Strategy
- **Generic Modules** â†’ `Parent-Child-Env Modules`  
  Each Azure service has its own dedicated, versioned Terraform module.  

- **This Repository** â†’ `crocus-iac-env-solutions`  
  Acts as the **root module** that:
  - Calls generic modules
  - Injects environment-specific configs
  - Defines dependencies

### High-Level Infrastructure Stack

```
Management Groups
- â””â”€â”€ Subscriptions 
-  â””â”€â”€ Resource Groups
-  â””â”€â”€ VNets & Subnets
-  â”œâ”€â”€ VPN Gateways
-  â”œâ”€â”€ Load Balancers
-  â”œâ”€â”€ Application Gateway / Front Door / Traffic-Manager
-  â””â”€â”€ AKS / ACR / Key Vault / Bastion

```

Landing zones are provisioned with a **hierarchical structure**, ensuring **isolation, security, and compliance**.

## Provisioning Flow

### Adding New Infrastructure (e.g., VM)
1. **Branch** â†’ Create a feature branch from `main`.  
2. **Code** â†’ Update Terraform configs to call required modules.  
3. **PR & Checks** â†’ Raise a PR to trigger pipeline:
   - `terraform validate`, `tflint`, `checkov`, `tfsec`, `trufflehog`
   - Chef InSpec compliance tests  
4. **Plan & Approve** â†’ `terraform plan` reviewed & approved (GenTest Job).  
5. **Apply** â†’ Changes applied to Development.  
6. **Promote to Prod** â†’ Additional governance approvals required.  

### Application Deployment (Monolithic & Microservices)
- **CI** â†’ PR triggers build, scans (SonarQube, Checkmarx), and artifact publishing to **Azure Artifacts**.  
- **CD** â†’ Artifacts deployed across environments (Dev â†’ Test â†’ QA â†’ Prod).  
- **Governance** â†’ Manual approvals at each promotion stage.  
- **Rollback** â†’ Dedicated rollback pipeline redeploys last stable artifact.
